# my-android-browser
Create a simple browser using android WebView. The browser will have bookmark, forward, and backward buttons on the main toolbar. You can also load your own html contents from Assets folder.

By default the app will load Wikipedia page of Android Nougat. Once you click on an external link (excluding Wikipedia links), the app will take you to another activity which resembles a real mobile browser.
